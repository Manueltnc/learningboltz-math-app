# Quick Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to deploy the Math Times Tables app to Vercel.

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] All code changes committed to git
- [ ] Supabase project created
- [ ] Database migrations run (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [ ] Supabase credentials ready:
  - [ ] Project URL
  - [ ] Anon key

## Push to GitHub

```bash
# If not already initialized
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Standalone app ready for deployment"

# Add remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Manueltnc/learningboltz-math-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploy to Vercel

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. [ ] Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. [ ] Click "Add New Project"
3. [ ] Import your GitHub repository
4. [ ] Framework should auto-detect as "Vite"
5. [ ] Configure settings:
   - [ ] Root Directory: `./` (leave empty)
   - [ ] Build Command: `npm run build` (should be auto-detected)
   - [ ] Output Directory: `dist` (should be auto-detected)
   - [ ] Install Command: `npm install` (should be auto-detected)
6. [ ] Add Environment Variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```
7. [ ] Click "Deploy"
8. [ ] Wait for deployment to complete

### Method 2: Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# For production
vercel --prod
```

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
- [ ] Test signup flow
- [ ] Test login flow
- [ ] Complete a placement test
- [ ] Start a practice session
- [ ] Verify progress is saved
- [ ] Check browser console (should be no errors)
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Verify database is updating

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Look for TypeScript errors
   - Verify all imports are correct
   - Check for missing dependencies

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Ensure they start with `VITE_`
   - Verify Supabase credentials are correct
   - Redeploy after adding variables

3. **Check Database**
   - Verify all migrations ran successfully
   - Check RLS policies are in place
   - Test direct Supabase connection

4. **Local Test Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Build completes without errors
âœ… App loads without console errors
âœ… Users can sign up and log in
âœ… Placement test works
âœ… Practice sessions save progress
âœ… Grid updates correctly
âœ… No 404 errors on navigation
âœ… Mobile responsive
